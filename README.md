## Snake Game in React

This is my first React project. Check out my Snake game at [https://mrlucasalmeida.github.io/SnakeGame-React/](https://mrlucasalmeida.github.io/SnakeGame-React/).

## Available Scripts

Navigate to the project directory,
```powershell
cd SnakeGame-React
```

Then run the following:

```powershell
npm install
```
```powershell
npm audit fix
```
If that doesn't work try:
```powershell
npm audit fix --force
```
Then to run the app run:
```powershell
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
